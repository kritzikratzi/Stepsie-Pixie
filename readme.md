# Stepsie Pixie (WIP!)




This is a small project that combines: 

* stepper motor (to move your camera)
* relais (to trigger virtually any SLR camera)
* display+buttons (to adjust a few settings in place)
* esp8266 (as a controller, if things go well it'll also offer a web-ui)


The repository contains the code for the Arduino IDE and (soon) the eagle layout for making the board.
